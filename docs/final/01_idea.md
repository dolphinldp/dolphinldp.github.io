# Idea - Zodiac Book STEMKit

This week I’m framing my FabAcademy final project: **a Zodiac Book STEMKit** — twelve book-sized STEM labs, one for every animal of the Chinese Zodiac. 

Each kit turns a 3D-printed, gear-driven creature into a moving, talking, codeable character using motors, LEDs, AI voices and browser-based blocks.

Because time is limit I’ll prototype the full stack on a single animal: the Horse. 
The 2026 is the Year of the Horse in the traditional Chinese zodiac. I hope to create a work related to the horse.


## Deliverable – Zodiac Book: AI Horse
My final project is an interactive “book” ,It contain a horse that can move legs, whinny, tell stories and obey wireless commands. 

Children write the code with drag-and-drop blocks in any web browser — no install, no wires.

It is an AI Book ,contains: a Movable Horse,  AI Voice chat and talking story,a wireless control.
Kids can use Blocky Coding web to control the horse,make the horse move , led lights,and horse talk or tone music.


### Features
1.**Movable Horse** 
ESP32-C3 + micro-servo legs, RGB mane and tail.

2.**AI Voice Chat** 
 ESP32-S3 with on-device wake-word,  speech-to-text and a tiny TTS engine so the horse can answer questions.

3.**Story-Teller Mode** 
The same voice module plays tales about the Horse, the Dragon, the Great Race and other zodiac legends (English & Chinese).

4.**Wireless Control** 
 BLE joystick , kids drive the horse or trigger light patterns from across the room.

5.**Web Blocky Coding** 
 Use the opensource MicroBlocks; one-click upload to ESP32 board; blocks for “gallop 3 steps”, “say ‘Hello’”,  “change eye colour”, etc.
